## Summary
It is the cold war. You are a commander in the soviet military, given an experimental, cutting edge device to train your tactical thinking: Чек, romanized as Chek.

It has top of the line graphics for the 60s, pushy buttons, tactically challenging concepts, and various glow-in-the-dark radioactive components. With Wide Area Network, Inter-Net connectivity, to allow you to build your skills against your fellow commanders!

## Why does this exist
This is a project I've made for my application to university. While I spent a lot of time developing games, I almost never end up releasing them.

I had intended it to just be a couple weeks long, but clearly this took more work than that!
